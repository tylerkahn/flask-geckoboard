flask-geckoboard
=================

Geckoboard_ is a hosted, real-time status board serving up indicators
from web analytics, CRM, support, infrastructure, project management,
sales, etc.  It can be connected to virtually any source of quantitative
data.

This Flask extension provides view decorators to help create custom
widgets.  This is under active refactoring from `django-geckoboard`_ so you
will need to use Git to get the development version from the `project page`_::

    $ git clone git://github.com/PolymathVentures/flask-geckoboard.git

See the ``geckoboard`` package docstring for documentation.
